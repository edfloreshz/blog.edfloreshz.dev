# Eduardo Flores

Hello, my name is Eddy. 

I'm a backend developer, I like to make small CLI apps like [Sensei](https://edfloreshz.github.io/sensei/), usually in Rust. I have a cat and I practice archery on weekends.

You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/edfloreshz), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/edfloreshz) and [Telegram](https://t.me/edfloreshz).
